# My Personal Website &nbsp;ðŸ¦Š
Thanks for taking the time to check out my site! This was fun to make, and it was only suiting since I got a new domain, but before we continue, I want to give a **HUGE** thanks to [Alistair Smith](https://github.com/alii), their site is where I drew inspriation from, along with some bits of code such as the grid background, and tailwind configuration.

I would've been stuck for hours without that being around, so you rock man! But hey, take a look around, maybe make a PR if you wanna see something changed, I'm always open to suggestions.

Anyways, this is Lavender signing off, cya later :D
